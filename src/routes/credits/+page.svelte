    <h3>Lucy Terry Prince: African American Experiences in Early Rural New England</h3>
    <p>
      This project will produce an engaging website that will increase understanding of New England slavery and African Americans in early rural New England. Its focus will be on Lucy Terry Prince, the first documented African American poet. Her life, from birth and captivity in Africa c.1726 to enslavement in Deerfield, MA, to her death as a free woman in Vermont in 1821, encompasses key experiences in the lives of African Americans. Lucy’s life illuminates important aspects of the Revolutionary era: a) how the slave trade and enslaved African American labor were instrumental in creating a thriving maritime economy in colonial New England; b) how desire for independence fueled by that economy gave rise to Revolutionary political principles that enslaved people seized upon to obtain their freedom; c) how African Americans struggled to enact those principles after the Revolution; and d) how, in this context, African Americans cultivated and expressed their humanity and self-determination.

      The <i>Lucy Terry Prince</i> website project grew out of PVMA’s African Americans in Rural New England project. Starting in 1994, the project has included an illustrated booklet Lucy Terry Prince: Singer of History by PVMA’s librarian, artist-in-residencies, African American history featured on our websites, installations memorializing African Americans, printed interpretive material of 23 African American sites in Deerfield, Black history exhibits, Juneteenth concerts, events, student and teacher programs, and an extensive database of early African American presence in the region.
