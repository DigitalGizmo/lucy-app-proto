          <h1>Sold Out of Africa</h1>
          <p class="story">
            Lucy with many other Africans are captured and taken away from all
            that is safe and familiar. Once she arrives at the coast she is
            imprisoned, sold, and taken onto a ship bound for a strange world
            thousands of miles from home.
          </p>
          <p class="history">
            An endless demand among European colonizers for the essential labor to
            produce sugar and other lucrative commodities is destroying the lives
            of millions of African men, women, and children. Their captors and
            others eager to profit from the booming trade in human beings engage
            in a brutal winnowing process. Imprisoned in slave castles and other
            holding areas on the West Africa coast, survivors are forced into the
            ships that will transport them thousands of miles to the Americas in
            the infamous Middle Passage.

          <h1>For Sale Again</h1>
          <p class="story">
            Three-year old Lucy is among a group of captured Africans for sale in
            Bristol, Rhode Island.
          </p>
          <p class="history">
            Africans who survive capture and the horrors of the Middle Passage
            encounter a new world where the loss of autonomy and the arbitrary
            power of their enslavers are the only constants.

          <h1>A Strange New Life</h1>
          <p class="story">
            Eight-year-old Lucy arrives in Deerfield and meets the couple who are
            purchasing her from Samuel Terry. Once again, her life is about to
            change but her status as an enslaved child does not.
          </p>
          <p class="history">
            Enslaved people often experienced multiple captivities. They could be
            sold at a momentâ€™s notice to new captors anytime, anywhere, upending
            in the process any relationships they may have been able to establish,
            including marriage, children and siblings. Dealing with the loss of
            old connections and forging new ones required resilience, courage, and
            persistence by young and old alike.
